                    <p>
                    Under data protection law, we can only use your personal data if we have a proper reason, eg:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <li>where you have given consent;</li>

                    <p> <l>we have your explicit consent; </l>
                    <l>the processing is necessary to protect your (or someone else’s) vital interests where you are physically or legally incapable of giving consent; or </l>
