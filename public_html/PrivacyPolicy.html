                    <p>
                    Under data protection law, we can only use your personal data if we have a proper reason, eg:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <li>where you have given consent;</li>
                    <li> to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations;</li>

                    <p> <l>we have your explicit consent; </l>
                    <l>the processing is necessary to protect your (or someone elseâ€™s) vital interests where you are physically or legally incapable of giving consent; or </l>
                    <l>the processing is necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. </l> </p>

                    <p>We have a legitimate interest in using your personal data for marketing purposes (see above â€˜How and why we use your personal dataâ€™). This means we do not usually need your consent to send you marketing information. If we change our marketing approach in the future so that consent is needed, we will ask for this separately and clearly. </p>
                    <p>You have the right to opt out of receiving marketing communications at any time by: </p>
                    <p><li>contacting us at info@timerni.com or +44 (0) 755 482 3078 ; </li>
